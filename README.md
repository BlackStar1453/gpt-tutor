    <em>GPT Tutor is a branch of OpenAI Translator, and I've made some modifications to it. I've added new features, such as categorizing prompts through grouping, one-click addition of responses to Anki, and removed unnecessary content. Additionally, I've fixed the functionality for using ChatGPT Web. GPT-Tutor is now more than just a translation tool; it has become a practical tool for assisting language learning.</em>
